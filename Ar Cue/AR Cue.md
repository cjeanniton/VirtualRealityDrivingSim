# How to Upload an FBX File Into Unity
(This documentation assumes that you have already created a digital model and now plan to incorprate it into Unity.)
## Converting from STL to FBX

If the file containing your AR cue model exists as an STL file, you will first want to connvert it to an FBX file, which is compatible with Unity. I suggest looking up "STL to FBX converter" on Google. If your file is in another format besides STL, look up a file converter that will give you back an FBX file.
