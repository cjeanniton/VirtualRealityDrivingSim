# Using AirSim APIs

## Set-Up Requirements

1. Make sure Unity and AirSim are installed and set-up and all requirements in [instructions] (https://github.com/p-misner/VirtualRealityDrivingSim/blob/master/README.md) are completed (Windridge City not necessary).
2. In the file explorer for your AirSim project, navigate into the PythonClient folder. This is where you'll find all the provided example scripts for AirSim's APIs. Double click on setup.py, which should install all the necessary packages (CHECK IF NEED TO INSTALL PYTHON FIRST).
