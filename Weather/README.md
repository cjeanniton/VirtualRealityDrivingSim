# Weather Control Notes
## Using Standard Asset Particle System

(https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ParticleSystems.html)

1. Add a dust storm from Unity Standard Assets (import if don't already have) Assets/StandardAssets/ParticleSystems/Prefabs

2. Change settings in dust storm

    - change color
    - change emission rate over time 
    - shape to box
    - simulation speed changes how fast cycle
    - change forces to look like blowing
    - turn off size over lifetime to avoid loops
    - max particles
