# Importing Car Model and Hands


## Unorganized Notes
* Install Unity Standard Assets from the Asset Store
... We used [Realisitc Car](#) bought from the Unity asset store but any car model can be used, including the standard asset car
... When the main camera is placed into the Realistic Car, the view might appear fuzzy. To fix this, select `remove all` buffers under `Target Display`.
